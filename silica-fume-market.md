<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silica Fume Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Densified silica fume</li><li>Semi densified silica fume</li><li>Undensified silica fume</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Silica fume is a byproduct of the production of silicon metal and ferrosilicon alloys. It is commonly used as a supplementary cementitious material in construction applications. Silica fume can be categorized into three market types: densified, semi-densified, and undensified. </p><p>Densified silica fume undergoes a treatment process that increases its bulk density, resulting in improved flowability and reduced air entrainment. Semi-densified silica fume is less dense than the densified variant but still offers enhanced performance characteristics. Undensified silica fume refers to the raw form without any treatment, exhibiting low bulk density and requiring additional processing for optimal performance.</p></p>
