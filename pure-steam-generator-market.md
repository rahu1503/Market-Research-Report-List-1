<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pure Steam Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Re-boiler Generator</li><li>Thermosyphon Generator/ External Rising Film Evaporator</li><li>Falling Film Evaporator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The pure steam generator market offers different types of generators such as re-boiler generators, thermosyphon generators/external rising film evaporators, and falling film evaporators. Re-boiler generators use a heat exchanger to generate pure steam by heating the feed water. Thermosyphon generators utilize an external heat source to create a vapor-liquid mixture that rises within the generator, separating the steam. Falling film evaporators involve the feed water forming a thin film on the outer surface of the heated tubes, which evaporates into pure steam. These different types cater to diverse industrial requirements for pure steam generation.</p></p>
