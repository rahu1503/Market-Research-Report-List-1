<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wheel Speed Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Magnetic Electric Type</li><li>Hall Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wheel speed sensors market comprises two types: magnetic electric type and Hall type. The magnetic electric type utilizes a magnetic ring and a coil to detect wheel speed. As the wheel rotates, the magnetic field generates an electric signal which is then processed to determine the speed. On the other hand, the Hall type utilizes Hall effect sensors to measure the rotational position of the wheel. These sensors detect changes in the magnetic field and convert them into electrical signals, providing information about the wheel speed.</p></p>
