<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cubic Zinc Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Process</li><li>Indirect Process</li><li>Wet Chemical Process</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cubic zinc oxide market can be categorized into four main types: direct process, indirect process, wet chemical process, and others. In the direct process, zinc vapor reacts with oxygen, resulting in the formation of cubic zinc oxide. In the indirect process, a zinc compound is first synthesized, and then it is oxidized to produce cubic zinc oxide. The wet chemical process involves the precipitation of zinc carbonate, which is subsequently transformed into cubic zinc oxide through calcination. The "others" category includes any other methods or processes not covered by the aforementioned three types.</p></p>
