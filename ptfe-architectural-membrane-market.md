<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTFE Architectural Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophobic PTFE Membrane</li><li>Hydrophilic PTFE Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PTFE architectural membrane refers to a type of material used in constructing membrane structures like roofs and facades. There are two main types of PTFE architectural membranes: hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophobic PTFE membranes are water-repellent, meaning they repel water and allow it to slide off easily. On the other hand, hydrophilic PTFE membranes are water-absorbent, allowing water to penetrate and pass through the material. Both types have specific applications and advantages, depending on factors like climate and intended use in architectural projects.</p></p>
