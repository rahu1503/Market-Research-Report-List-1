<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Control Servo Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cored Motor</li><li>Coreless Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radio control servo market is divided into two types, namely cored motor and coreless motor. Cored motor servos utilize a motor with a core made of iron, which provides higher torque and is suitable for applications requiring more power, such as large-scale vehicles. On the other hand, coreless motor servos have a motor without a core, making them lighter and faster, perfect for smaller and lightweight applications like airplanes or helicopters. Both types serve specific needs and cater to different requirements in the radio control servo market.</p></p>
