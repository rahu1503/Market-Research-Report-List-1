<p><strong>The Shape-Memory Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Temperature-induced</li><li>Light-induced</li><li>Electricity-induced</li><li>Other (PH, Magnetic, etc.)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shape-memory polymers are a type of smart material that can retain their original shape after being deformed, by a temperature-induced, light-induced, electricity-induced, or other stimulus. Temperature-induced shape-memory polymers change shape in response to a change in temperature. Light-induced shape-memory polymers respond to specific wavelengths of light, causing them to change shape. Electricity-induced shape-memory polymers can change shape when an electric current is applied. Other types of shape-memory polymers, such as pH or magnetic-induced, change shape in response to changes in their surrounding pH levels or in the presence of a magnetic field.</p></p>
