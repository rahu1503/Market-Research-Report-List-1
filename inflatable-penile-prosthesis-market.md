<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inflatable Penile Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>3-piece</li><li>Semi-inflatable and Semi-rigid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The inflatable penile prosthesis market consists of three main types: 3-piece, semi-inflatable, and semi-rigid devices. A 3-piece prosthesis includes a fluid-filled reservoir implanted in the abdomen, a pump placed in the scrotum, and inflatable cylinders in the penis. When the user desires an erection, they activate the pump to transfer fluid into the cylinders. Semi-inflatable prostheses are similar but lack the dedicated reservoir, instead, using a pump placed inside the scrotum to directly inflate the cylinders. Semi-rigid prostheses maintain a constant partially erect state, enabling satisfactory penetration but lacking the ability to inflate or deflate.</p></p>
