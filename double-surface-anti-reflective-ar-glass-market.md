<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Surface Anti-Reflective (AR) Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double layers</li><li>Four layers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Double Surface Anti-Reflective (AR) Glass is categorized into two main types: double layers and four layers. </p><p>In the case of double-layer AR glass, the glass is coated with a single layer or film on both surfaces, which helps to reduce reflection and increase light transmission, resulting in improved visibility and reduced glare. </p><p>On the other hand, four-layer AR glass consists of multiple layers of coatings on both sides of the glass, offering even higher anti-reflective properties, enhanced durability, and better scratch resistance. Both types serve the purpose of minimizing reflections and enhancing optical performance.</p></p>
