<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cationic Dyes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isolated Type</li><li>Conjugate Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cationic dyes are classified into two main types: isolated type and conjugate type. The isolated type refers to a dye molecule that is cationic (positively charged) and remains separate from the material it is dyeing. This type is commonly used in the dyeing of acrylic and modacrylic fibers. On the other hand, the conjugate type refers to a cationic dye that is covalently bonded to the material being dyed, resulting in better color fastness. This type is predominantly employed for the dyeing of natural and synthetic fibers.</p></p>
