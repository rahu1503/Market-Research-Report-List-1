<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Patient Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Animal Patient Monitor market consists of two major types: invasive and non-invasive monitors. Invasive monitors require the insertion of a probe or sensor into the animal's body to measure vital signs and parameters. This type of monitoring provides highly accurate and real-time data but carries the risk of infection and tissue damage. On the other hand, non-invasive monitors do not require any intrusion into the animal's body and measure vital signs externally. Although non-invasive monitoring is less accurate and may have limitations, it is generally safer and more comfortable for animals.</p></p>
