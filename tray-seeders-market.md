<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tray Seeders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic Needle</li><li>Pneumatic Drum</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Tray seeders are agricultural machines used for sowing seeds. The market for tray seeders can be classified into two types: pneumatic needle and pneumatic drum. In pneumatic needle tray seeders, seeds are placed into individual cells of a tray by using a needle-like device. This method is suitable for small seeds and ensures precise placement. On the other hand, pneumatic drum tray seeders use a rotating drum to distribute seeds evenly into the tray cells. This method is suitable for larger seeds and allows for faster sowing.</p></p>
