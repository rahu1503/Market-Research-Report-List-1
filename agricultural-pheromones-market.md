<p><strong>The Agricultural Pheromones Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sex Pheromones</li><li>Aggregation Pheromones</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural pheromones refer to chemical signals produced by organisms in the agricultural industry to communicate with each other. There are three main types of agricultural pheromones: sex pheromones, aggregation pheromones, and others. Sex pheromones are released by one organism to attract a mate of the opposite sex. Aggregation pheromones are produced to gather individuals of the same species together. The "others" category includes pheromones used for specific purposes such as alarm pheromones to warn others of danger or trail pheromones to mark paths. These pheromones play a crucial role in pest control and crop management strategies.</p></p>
