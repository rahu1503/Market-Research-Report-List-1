<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transport Hyperbaric Chamber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Pressured Hyperbaric Chamber</li><li>Oxygen Pressured Hyperbaric Chamber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transport hyperbaric chambers are used for providing therapeutic treatment in environments with higher than atmospheric pressure. There are two main types: air pressured and oxygen pressured hyperbaric chambers. Air pressured hyperbaric chambers use compressed air to create environments with increased pressure, allowing patients to breathe 100% oxygen. On the other hand, oxygen pressured hyperbaric chambers directly supply pure oxygen, avoiding the need for patients to breathe compressed air. Both types offer effective treatment options for conditions such as decompression sickness, wound healing, and carbon monoxide poisoning.</p></p>
