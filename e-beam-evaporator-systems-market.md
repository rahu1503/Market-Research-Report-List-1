<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The E-Beam Evaporator Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-pocket e-beam Sources</li><li>Single Pocket e-beam Sources</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The E-Beam Evaporator Systems market comprises two main types: Multi-pocket e-beam sources and Single pocket e-beam sources. Multi-pocket e-beam sources refer to systems that have multiple pockets, or chambers, where different materials can be placed for evaporation. This allows for the deposition of multiple materials in a single run, making it efficient for producing complex thin-film structures. On the other hand, Single pocket e-beam sources consist of a single chamber for material evaporation, limiting the deposition to a single material at a time. These systems are suitable for simpler thin-film structures.</p></p>
