<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Al-RE Alloy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Eutectic</li><li>Hypereutectic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Al-RE alloy market consists of different types, namely single eutectic and hypereutectic alloys. Single eutectic alloys have a composition where a single eutectic phase is formed upon solidification, resulting in a fine microstructure and good mechanical properties. On the other hand, hypereutectic alloys contain a higher concentration of RE elements, exceeding the eutectic ratio. This excess of RE elements leads to the formation of primary intermetallic phases, which can impact the alloy's properties. These market types provide options for manufacturers to select alloys based on specific performance requirements.</p></p>
