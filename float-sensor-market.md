<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Float Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top-mounted Type</li><li>Side-Mounted Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The float sensor market includes two main types: top-mounted type and side-mounted type. The top-mounted type is installed on top of a liquid tank, with the float moving up and down as the liquid level changes. This type is commonly used in applications where the liquid needs to be completely emptied or filled. On the other hand, the side-mounted type is installed on the side of the tank, and the float moves horizontally with the liquid level. This type is often used when there are space constraints or when continuous level monitoring is required.</p></p>
