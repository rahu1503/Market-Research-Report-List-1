<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oocyte Aspiration Needles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Lumen</li><li>Double-lumen</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Oocyte aspiration needles are medical devices used in assisted reproductive technology procedures to retrieve eggs from a woman's ovaries. There are two main types of oocyte aspiration needles: single lumen and double-lumen. </p><p>A single lumen needle has a single channel through which the aspiration takes place. It is commonly used for standard oocyte retrievals. </p><p>On the other hand, a double-lumen needle has two separate channels. One channel is used for aspiration, while the other is used for flushing fluids during the retrieval process. This type of needle is often used in more complex cases or when additional fluids need to be introduced into the system.</p></p>
