<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fishing Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Digital Sonar</li><li>Imaging Sonar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fishing sonar technology has evolved into two main types: digital sonar and imaging sonar. Digital sonar uses sound waves to create a visual display of what is beneath the water's surface. It provides fishermen with real-time information about the depth, structure, and presence of fish. On the other hand, imaging sonar offers a more detailed and high-definition view of underwater objects, allowing for better identification of fish species and tracking their movement. Both digital sonar and imaging sonar are essential tools for fishermen, aiding in their ability to locate and catch fish effectively.</p></p>
