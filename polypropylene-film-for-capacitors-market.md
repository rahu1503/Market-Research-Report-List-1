<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polypropylene Film for Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metallized PP Film</li><li>BOPP Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polypropylene film for capacitors is divided into two types: metallized PP film and BOPP film. Metallized PP film is coated with a thin layer of metal, usually aluminum, which enhances its conductivity and reduces the size of the capacitor. This type of film is commonly used in high-frequency applications. On the other hand, BOPP film stands for biaxially oriented polypropylene film, which is widely used in low to medium-frequency applications. It offers good electrical insulation and mechanical strength, making it suitable for various capacitor applications.</p></p>
