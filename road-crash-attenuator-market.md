<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Crash Attenuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Redirective Crash Attenuator</li><li>Non-redirective Crash Attenuator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Road crash attenuators are safety devices designed to absorb the impact energy during a collision, reducing the severity of damage and injuries. Redirective crash attenuators use mechanisms that redirect the impacting vehicle away from the hazard, minimizing the risk of secondary crashes. Non-redirective crash attenuators, on the other hand, absorb the impact energy without redirecting the vehicle. Both types play crucial roles in road safety by safeguarding motorists and mitigating the consequences of accidents.</p></p>
