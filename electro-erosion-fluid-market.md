<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electro-Erosion Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coloured</li><li>Colourless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electro-Erosion Fluid market can be divided into two main types: coloured and colourless. Coloured electro-erosion fluids are formulated with pigments to provide visual indication and better visibility during the machining process. They are commonly used for precision applications where precise cutting and shaping are required. On the other hand, colourless electro-erosion fluids do not contain any pigments and are used when visibility is not a major concern or when compatibility with certain materials is a priority. Both types serve different purposes depending on the needs of the machining process.</p></p>
