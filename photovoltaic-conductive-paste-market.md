<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photovoltaic Conductive Paste Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Al Paste</li><li>Ag Paste</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Photovoltaic (PV) conductive paste market is segmented into two main types: Al (aluminum) paste and Ag (silver) paste. Al paste is widely used due to its low cost and good adhesion to Silicon wafers. It provides excellent electrical conductivity and is suitable for manufacturing large-scale solar cells. Conversely, Ag paste is known for its high conductivity, making it ideal for high-efficiency solar cells. However, it is more expensive than Al paste. The choice between the two depends on factors like cost, efficiency, and specific manufacturing requirements.</p></p>
