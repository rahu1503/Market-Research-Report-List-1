<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Split Septum Needleless Connector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Fluid Displacement</li><li>Negative Fluid Displacement</li><li>Neutral Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Split Septum Needleless Connector Market is divided into three types: Positive Fluid Displacement, Negative Fluid Displacement, and Neutral Displacement. Positive Fluid Displacement connectors actively expel fluid during connection, reducing the risk of bloodstream infections. Negative Fluid Displacement connectors draw back fluid during disconnection, preventing blood reflux. Neutral Displacement connectors neither expel nor draw back fluid, making them suitable for use with both positive and negative pressure systems. These different types cater to specific medical needs and help minimize the risk of contamination and infection during medical procedures.</p></p>
