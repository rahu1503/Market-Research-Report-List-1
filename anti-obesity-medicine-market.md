Some prominent companies in this space include Alizyme, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eisai, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Orexigen Therapeutics, Vivus, Pfizer, Roche, Merck, and Novo Nordisk.</p><p>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is one of the leading players in the anti-obesity medicine market. The company has a long history of developing and marketing pharmaceutical products. With a focus on research and development (R&D), GSK strives to bring innovative solutions to address obesity. Belviq (Lorcaserin) is one of the key anti-obesity drugs marketed by GSK.

According to their financial reports, GSK's revenue from pharmaceuticals, including anti-obesity drugs, was approximately $33.93 billion in 2020.</p><p>Novo Nordisk, a global healthcare company headquartered in Denmark, is also a major player in the anti-obesity medicine market.

However, in 2012, Bristol Myers Squibb discontinued its anti-obesity drug development program, which included Byetta for weight loss.

Companies like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Novo Nordisk have witnessed significant market growth and offer effective anti-obesity drugs.
