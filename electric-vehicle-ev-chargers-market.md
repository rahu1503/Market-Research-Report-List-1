<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle (EV) Chargers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Board Chargers</li><li>Off-Board Chargers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electric Vehicle (EV) Chargers can be classified into two types: On-Board Chargers and Off-Board Chargers. On-Board Chargers are built into the electric vehicle itself and are responsible for converting AC power from the electric grid into DC power to charge the vehicle's battery. Off-Board Chargers, on the other hand, are external charging stations that are separate from the vehicle. They are typically installed in public spaces and provide a higher charging rate, allowing users to quickly recharge their EVs. Both types play a crucial role in facilitating the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.</p></p>
