<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ribbed Steel Bars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-rolling</li><li>Cold rolling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ribbed steel bars are widely used in the construction industry and are available in two major market types: hot-rolling and cold rolling. Hot-rolling involves heating the steel billet and passing it through rollers to create the ribbed texture, enhancing the overall strength. This process allows for faster production but requires a higher temperature. On the other hand, cold rolling involves passing the steel billet through rollers without heating it, producing a smoother surface. This method takes longer but results in steel bars with improved dimensional accuracy and surface finish.</p></p>
