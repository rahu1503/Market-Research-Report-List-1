<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endogenous Creatinine Assay Kits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Jaffe's Kinetic Method</li><li>Enzymatic Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Endogenous creatinine assay kits are used for the measurement of creatinine levels in biological samples. There are two main types of these kits: Jaffe's Kinetic Method and Enzymatic Method. Jaffe's Kinetic Method involves a reaction between creatinine and picric acid, producing a colored product that is proportional to the creatinine concentration. The Enzymatic Method uses enzymes to convert creatinine into a measurable product. Both methods provide accurate and reliable results, allowing for the assessment of kidney function and other medical applications.</p></p>
